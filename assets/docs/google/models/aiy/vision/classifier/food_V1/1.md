## Overview

This model is trained to recognize 2023 food dishes from images. It is based on
[MobileNet V1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861).

### Input

This model takes images as input.

*   Inputs are expected to be 3-channel RGB color images of size 224 x 224,
    scaled to [0, 1].

### Output

This model outputs to `image_classifier`.

*   `image_classifier`: A probability vector of dimension 2024, corresponding to
    a `background` class and one of 2023 food dishes in the
    [labelmap](https://www.gstatic.com/aihub/tfhub/labelmaps/aiy_food_V1_labelmap.csv).

## Example use

```python

# TF1 version
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.Module('https://tfhub.dev/google/aiy/vision/classifier/food_V1/1')
...

# TF2 version
import tensorflow.compat.v2 as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

m = hub.KerasLayer('https://tfhub.dev/google/aiy/vision/classifier/food_V1/1')
...
```

## Model architecture

For details of the model architecture, see
[MobileNet V1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861).

## Suitable usecases

-   This model is trained to recognize 2023 food dishes. The training set
    includes entrees, side dishes, desserts, snacks, etc.

## Unsuitable usecases

-   Do not use this model to determine whether an object is edible or not.
-   This model is not suitable for predicting the ingredients of a food dish. Do
    not use this model to predict allergen or nutrition information.

## Known limitations

-   This model assumes that its input image contains a well-cropped food dish.
    If a non-food image is input to the model or if the dish is not
    well-cropped, the output of the model may be meaningless.
-   This model was trained on a dataset skewed toward North American foods.
